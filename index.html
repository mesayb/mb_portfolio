            <p>On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and
                demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment,
                so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal
                blame belongs to those who fail in their duty
                through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases
                are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish.
                In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do
                what we like best, every pleasure is to be
                welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the
                obligations of business it will frequently occur
                that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in
                these matters to this principle of selection:
                he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains
